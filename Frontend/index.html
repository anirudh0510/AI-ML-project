        <h2>ðŸ“Š Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Football Analysis System is a machine learning-based tool that
          processes match videos to generate deep insights. It identifies and
          tracks players in real-time, measures their speed and movement, and
          calculates ball control percentages for each team. This system is
          designed to assist coaches, analysts, and sports broadcasters by
          providing real-time tactical intelligence and performance evaluation.
          With its visual overlays and precision tracking, it revolutionizes how
          football data is analyzed and presented.
