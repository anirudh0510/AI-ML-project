# Football Analysis System

## Overview
The Football Analysis System is an AI/ML project designed to analyze football matches using computer vision techniques. By leveraging YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OpenCV for image processing, this system can identify players, track movements, and gather statistics from match footage.

## Features
<uol>
  <li><b>Real-time Player Detection:</b> Utilizes YOLO to identify players on the field in real time.</li>
  <li><b>Movement Tracking:</b> Tracks player movements over the course of the match.</li>
  <li><b>Statistical Analysis:</b> Gathers and displays various statistics, such as player positions, distance covered, and more.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization:</b> Offers visual feedback through annotated video output.</li>
</uol>

## Technologies Used
<uol>
  <li><b>Python:</b> Main programming language for the project.</li>
  <li><b>YOLO:</b> State-of-the-art object detection system.</li>
  <li><b>OpenCV:</b> Library for computer vision tasks.</li>
  <li><b>NumPy:</b> Library for numerical operations.</li>
  <li><b>Matplotlib:</b> For visualizing statistics and results.</li>
</uol>

## Usage
<ol>
  <li>Ensure you have the YOLO weights and configuration files. You can download them from the official YOLO repository or use pre-trained weights.</li>
  <Li>Place the video file you want to analyze in the videos directory.</Li>
  <li>Run the analysis script: "python analyze.py --video_path videos/your_video.mp4"</li>
  <li>The output will be saved in the output directory with annotated frames and a statistics report.</li>
</ol>
